<h1>Tinder with Chuck</h1>

<p>Hi. Welcome to my first Flutter project page!</p>

<p>It is an android app that will make you smile (at least, I hope so).</p>

<p>So let's start our introductory tour of the app!</p>

## About the project

Tinder with Chuck Norris is an android app where the user can read jokes about Chuck Norris from [this site](https://api.chucknorris.io). The app has two screens: Home and Favorites. But I suggest we start with the welcoming app icon.

## Icon

The app icon was prepared with [Figma](https://www.figma.com) in three variants. Having overcome meal choice, I decided on the left one.

To add the icon I followed [this tutorial](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons).

## Home

The home page displays the jokes parsed in random order.
The app has a swipe feature. So here, just like in Tender, you are able to like/dislike the jokes - swipe to the right or to the left respectively.

By swiping to the right jokes are saved for further display on the Favorite screen.

## Favorites

On the Favorites page, you can find your favorite jokes displayed in a list. This list can be scrolled, so don't worry, all your jokes will be saved.

You can also click on each item in the list with a simple or long press. With a long press, checkboxes will appear to the right of all the jokes in the list, and you can also click on them.

I will use this functionality a little later to add the ability to delete the jokes and to see the full version of them.
